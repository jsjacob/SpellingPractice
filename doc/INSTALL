Requirements
------------

SpellingPractice was written for the Java 2 platform version 1.3.1 or
higher and has been tested on MS Windows 98, Mac OS X 10.2, and Red
Hat Linux 9. Sound input (e.g., microphone) and output (e.g.,
speakers) are also required.


Windows:

On Windows 98 machines with 32 MB of RAM or lower, the Sun Java
Runtime Environment 1.4.1 has problems with graphics. The IBM Java
Runtime Environment 1.3.1 is recommended when running on Windows 98
with 32 MB of RAM or lower.

1) Create the folder "C:\Program Files\SpellingPractice"

2) Copy the following files to "C:\Program Files\SpellingPractice":
   * SpellingPractice-Teacher.jar
   * SpellingPractice-Student.jar
   * doc\example\win32\spteacher.bat
   * doc\example\win32\spstudent.bat
   * doc\example\win32\spteacher.rc
   * doc\example\win32\spstudent.rc
   * doc\example\win32\Teacher - SpellingPractice.pif
   * doc\example\win32\Student - SpellingPractice.pif

3) Edit spteacher.bat and spstudent.bat and uncomment (i.e., remove
   the "REM") from the batch script line for your Java Runtime
   Environment. If you are using Sun's JRE, then the line

   set JRE_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\j2re1.4.1"

   should be uncommented. If you are using IBM's JRE, then the line

   set JRE_HOME="C:\WSDK\sdk\jre"

   should be uncommented.

4) Edit spteacher.rc and spstudent.rc if you would like to customize
   any parameters. The standard settings should suffice for most
   installations.

5) Double-click on "Teacher - SpellingPractice" or
   "Student - SpellingPractice" to run the programs.


Mac OS X:

On Mac OS X 10.2 and below, the Java Runtime Environment Sound API
cannot record sound. Words and associated audio can be file-copied
from other platforms.

1) Create the folder "/Users/Shared/SpellingPractice"

2) Copy the following files to "/Users/Shared/SpellingPractice":
   * SpellingPractice-Teacher.jar
   * SpellingPractice-Student.jar
   * doc/example/macosx/spteacher.rc
   * doc/example/macosx/spstudent.rc

3) Edit spteacher.rc and spstudent.rc if you would like to customize
   any parameters. The standard settings should suffice for most
   installations.

4) Double-click on "SpellingPractice-Teacher.jar" or
   "SpellingPractice-Student.jar" to run the programs.


Linux:

On Linux, the Sun Java Runtime Environment has problems with
sound. The IBM Java Runtime Environment 1.3.1 is recommended when
running on Linux.

1) Create the directory "/usr/local/SpellingPractice"

2) Copy the following files to "/usr/local/SpellingPractice":
   * SpellingPractice-Teacher.jar
   * SpellingPractice-Student.jar
   * doc/example/unix/spteacher.rc
   * doc/example/unix/spstudent.rc
   * doc/example/unix/spteacher.sh
   * doc/example/unix/spstudent.sh

3) Run the following commands to make the shell scripts executable:
   % chmod +x /usr/local/SpellingPractice/spteacher.sh
   % chmod +x /usr/local/SpellingPractice/spstudent.sh

4) Edit spteacher.sh and spstudent.sh and uncomment (i.e., remove
   the "#") from the shell script line for your Java Runtime
   Environment. If you are using IBM's JRE, then the line

   JRE_HOME=/opt/IBMJava2-131/jre

   should be uncommented. If you are using Sun's JRE, then the line

   JRE_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.1/jre

   should be uncommented.

5) Edit spteacher.rc and spstudent.rc if you would like to customize
   any parameters. The standard settings should suffice for most
   installations.

6) Run the shell scripts from the command line to run the programs.
   % /usr/local/SpellingPractice/spteacher.sh
   % /usr/local/SpellingPractice/spstudent.sh
